- 👋 Hi, I’m @DrDeb
- 👀 I’m interested in genomic analysis, RNAseq data. I also raise colored wool sheep and goats..
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about linux-based systems and data analysis with command line software. I'm currently working on RNAseq data for Acinetobacter baumannii in a microbiology lab..
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on color genetic studies in sheep and/or goats. Also need help time to time with troubleshooting what I'm doing wrong in completing analyses...
- 📫 I can be reached at in2paints@gmail.com
